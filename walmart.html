            <h2>Keep a specific route  </h2>
            <p>Put your shopping list in order, then follow the route. Any time you spend crossing the store or doubling back can distract you from your list and from your budget. The location of every category and item is available online, which allows you to fully plan for only the sections you need.</p>

            <h2>Know your brands  </h2>
            <p>Walmart carries a wide array of brands for each product. Knowing which brands are the best quality and value can be critical in making the most of your shopping. Keep note of brands that do not meet your expectations, and look for alternatives. Depending on the product, you can find the same quality at a far lower price. Spending a little extra can also save a lot when the product quality is significantly different.</p>
