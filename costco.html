                ▪︎ Do Not Shop Hungry
            </h2>
            <p> 
                This advice is useful for any shopping outing, it is especially important at Costco. 
                Shopping hungry can lead to impulse buys and overshopping. Luckily, Costco offers a built in solution in the food court. 
                If you ever end up at Costco hungry, spending a few dollars at the food court before shopping can save you dozens in preventable mistakes.

            <h2 class="heading-costco">▪︎ Know How Much You can Handle </h2>
            <p> 
                Many of the deals in Costco cannot be matched anywhere, 
                but this does not mean they are all the right fit for you. 
                If your household cannot take care of a bulk item before it goes bad, 
                then it is out of your budget. If you are throwing away products, you are throwing away money.
