        <h1>Basic Shopping tips</h1>
        <div>
            <h2>Start with a list </h2>
            <p>Shopping without a list is a quick way to lose time, money, and focus. A shopping list gives your trip purpose. Many of the tricks included in ShopSmart can only work if you have a list. A shopping list is the best first step, as it will help you determine other factors about your trip, such as store and budget. The list can be as simple as only the items themselves. More advanced shoppers can also include details such as brands, prices, and in-store locations.</p>

            <h2>Set up a budget </h2>
            <p>Know how much you're going to spend on each outing. Use the prices from the list you created to set a starting budget, then add a small amount on the side. That small amount will be for items that you forgot, or items you discover while shopping. By setting aside a set amount of money for these incidentals, you can prevent overspending and be able to plan your shopping expenses more accurately, while still allowing room for flexibility. </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Give yourself a time limit </h2>
            <p>The longer you spend inside a store, the more likely you will buy something you didn't mean to. Set a strict limit with yourself on how long you are able to be in the store. Base that amount of time on your list and how long you usually take to shop. Once your time runs out,  keep yourself accountable and go straight to checkout. After each trip, adjust the amount of time you will give yourself the next time to make sure you have enough, but not too much time.</p>

            <h2>Non-spending research trips</h2>
            <p>Do you need to gather information on a product, or need to see how something feels in person before buying? Go to the store without any money on you. Informational trips are important, but can be an easy way to make a shopping mistake. Prevent yourself from getting anything while you are doing research, and only go in with money when you know exactly what you will be getting.</p>
